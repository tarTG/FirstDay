# First Day (experimental Project)

With this project i play arround with [the Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). The main focus is about 2D Lightning, Shadereffects and, if i find the time, procedural generation.

Maybe someday it will be a playable game, but right now, its far away from usable.
